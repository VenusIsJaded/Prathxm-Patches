#
# <FlowInterface> is the app's obfuscated kotlinx Flow interface (the return type of the
# hooked GameAnalysisRepositoryImpl method), e.g. com.google.android.xh4 for 4.10.17.
# The patch passes this class to the extension at runtime via const-class, so the harness
# does the same.
#
# Steps: dex2jar the app -> compile extension + harness against android.jar (with small
# JVM stubs for android.util.Log / ActivityThread) -> run the harness. Exit code 0 = pass.
